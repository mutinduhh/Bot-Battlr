# Bot-Battlr
# Bot Battlr README
Welcome to Bot Battlr, a React application that allows users to browse and manage their own bot army!

# Project Overview
In this project, I implemented a mini web app to practice components, props, state, events, and data fetching in React. The app displays a list of available bots, allowing users to add, release, and discharge bots from their army.

# Features
Display a list of available bots in the BotCollection component
Add an individual bot to the user's army by clicking on it, rendering it in the YourBotArmy component
Release a bot from the user's army by clicking on it, removing it from the YourBotArmy component
Discharge a bot from service forever by clicking the red "x" button, deleting it from the backend and frontend
Setup
To set up the project, follow these steps:

Create a new project folder and a new private GitHub repository.
Add your TM as a contributor to the project (for grading purposes only).
Create a db.json file in the project directory and use the provided data for the server DB.
Run json-server --watch db.json to start the backend server.
Test the server by visiting http://localhost:8001/bots in the browser.
Core Deliverables
The project conforms to the following guidelines:

As a user, I should be able to see profiles of all bots rendered in BotCollection.
As a user, I should be able to add an individual bot to my army by clicking on it.
As a user, I should be able to release a bot from my army by clicking on it.
As a user, I should be able to discharge a bot from service forever by clicking the red "x" button.
