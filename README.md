# Bot Battlr README
Welcome to Bot Battlr, a React application that allows users to browse and manage their own bot army!

# Project Overview
In this project, I implemented a mini web app to practice components, props, state, events, and data fetching in React. The app displays a list of available bots, allowing users to add, release, and discharge bots from their army.

# Features
Display a list of available bots in the BotCollection component
Add an individual bot to the user's army by clicking on it, rendering it in the YourBotArmy component
Release a bot from the user's army by clicking on it, removing it from the YourBotArmy component
Discharge a bot from service forever by clicking the red "x" button, deleting it from the backend and frontend
Setup
To set up the project, follow these steps:

After cloning down the project:

Run npm install in your terminal
Run npm start: This will open both your React page on port 6002 and your backend on port 6001.
